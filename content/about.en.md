## Hi, I’m Javi.

I study Mathematics, and what fascinates me most is the intuition behind abstract ideas. I believe that understanding a proof is not just about following logical steps, but also about grasping the vision that inspired it. To truly understand mathematics is to feel as if you could have discovered it yourself—to step into the mind of Newton, Weierstrass, or Leibniz and see the motivation behind each discovery.

This blog is a space to explore mathematics at a thoughtful pace: from fundamental concepts to unexpected connections with fields like philosophy, physics, or computer science. My aim is to combine rigor and clarity, without losing sight of the beauty and inner logic that make this discipline unique.

I hope you enjoy and learn from reading this blog as much as I do from writing it.
